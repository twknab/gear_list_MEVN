# Gear List

This is a gear list application, designed to help you in outdoor adventures to better prepare and not forget those important (sometimes live-saving) items at home.

In regards to technology, this is a MEVN application and uses:

1. (M)ongoDB for the database.
2. (E)xpress.js and (N)ode.js for back-end server functionality.
3. (V)ue.js for the front-end framework and client-side routing. 

[Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) is used to handle SPA routing, and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is used for AJAX requests to the backend.

This project generated using [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).
